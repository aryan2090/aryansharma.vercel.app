# About me

Hello there! I am Aryan Sharma, a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a Master's degree in Data Science, building upon a strong foundation in Computer Science. My professional journey includes impactful roles like a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon, where I engineered a distributed locking mechanism that eliminated job queue blockages and significantly improved system reliability. I'm driven by the challenge of transforming complex data into actionable insights and robust solutions, as demonstrated in my work at Genpact where I developed models that reduced customer churn by 30%.

Beyond industry applications, I have a deep interest in research, particularly in pioneering innovative AI systems. My work includes developing a high-accuracy, real-time two-handed sign language translation framework using deep learning, and architecting models for cardiac anomaly detection in wearable devices. My core research interest lies in creating and developing scalable machine learning systems that have a tangible, real-world impact, leveraging machine learning and deep learning to address complex challenges and contribute to advancements in fields like human-computer interaction and efficient AI.

When I'm not immersed in data or code, I enjoy the strategic play of table tennis, exploring captivating narratives in manga and anime, and engaging with the thought-provoking ideas found in philosophy books.
