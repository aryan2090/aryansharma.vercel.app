    "intro": "I'm Aryan Sharma, a recent Master's graduate in Data Science from the University of Michigan. I'm passionate about transforming data into impactful solutions, demonstrated by engineering a system-stabilizing distributed locking mechanism at Amazon and developing models at Genpact that slashed customer churn. My research focuses on pioneering innovative and scalable machine learning systems with real-world impact, including a high-accuracy real-time sign language translator and cardiac anomaly detection models. Beyond data, I enjoy table tennis, manga/anime, and philosophy.",
