## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A visitor navigating to the Awards page expects to see a consistent visual representation of achievements. Currently, awards display a generic placeholder image, which doesn't convey the significance or nature of the recognition. The visitor should see an appropriate award/trophy icon for each award entry, making it immediately clear that these are achievements and honors.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the /awards page, **When** the page loads, **Then** each award entry displays a trophy/award icon instead of a placeholder image

2. **Given** a visitor views an award entry, **When** they see the visual icon, **Then** the icon clearly represents an award or achievement (trophy, medal, or similar)

3. **Given** multiple awards are displayed on the page, **When** the visitor scans the page, **Then** all awards show the same consistent award icon

4. **Given** the awards page is viewed on mobile devices, **When** the icons are displayed, **Then** the award icons are clearly visible and appropriately sized

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the award icon image file is missing or fails to load?
- How does the icon display on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)?
- What happens if new awards are added to the data - do they automatically get the award icon?
