# Tasks: Display Award Icon for Awards

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-the-awards-mentioned/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, quickstart.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
This is a Next.js web application with Pages Router:
- Pages: `pages/` at repository root
- Components: `components/` at repository root
- Data: `public/jsons/` at repository root
- Images: `public/images/` at repository root

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Verification

- [x] T001 Verify development server is running on http://localhost:3001 (or start with `npm run dev`)
- [x] T002 Verify trophy icon exists at /public/images/trophy.png
- [x] T003 Navigate to http://localhost:3001/awards and confirm awards display with placeholder images (baseline before changes)

## Phase 3.2: Content Update

**IMPORTANT: Content-only change - no code modifications**

- [x] T004 Modify public/jsons/awards.json to add `"image": "/images/trophy.png"` field to first award entry (line 3)
- [x] T005 Modify public/jsons/awards.json to add `"image": "/images/trophy.png"` field to second award entry (line 8)

**Expected Result**: Each award object should have the structure:
```json
{
    "title": "...",
    "position": "...",
    "date": "...",
    "image": "/images/trophy.png"
}
```

## Phase 3.3: Visual Verification (from quickstart.md Test Suite 1)

**IMPORTANT: Manual testing required - verify trophy icons display correctly**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - Open http://localhost:3001/awards in browser

- [ ] T006 Execute TC-1.1: Navigate to http://localhost:3001/awards and verify trophy icons display instead of placeholders (see quickstart.md lines 18-26)
- [ ] T007 Execute TC-1.2: Inspect image element src attribute, verify it's `/images/trophy.png` not `/images/placeholder.png` (see quickstart.md lines 28-32)
- [ ] T008 Execute TC-1.3: Verify all awards show consistent trophy icon, no placeholders or different icons (see quickstart.md lines 34-40)

## Phase 3.4: Responsive Testing (from quickstart.md Test Suite 2)

**IMPORTANT: Test on multiple device sizes per constitutional requirement**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - Use browser DevTools responsive mode

- [ ] T009 Execute TC-2.1: Resize browser to 375px width (mobile), verify trophy icons are visible and appropriately sized (see quickstart.md lines 46-53)
- [ ] T010 Execute TC-2.2: Resize browser to 768px width (tablet), verify trophy icons display correctly (see quickstart.md lines 55-61)
- [ ] T011 Execute TC-2.3: Resize browser to 1920px width (desktop), verify trophy icons match work experience logo sizing (see quickstart.md lines 63-69)

## Phase 3.5: Performance Verification (from quickstart.md Test Suite 3)

**IMPORTANT: Constitutional requirement - no performance degradation**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - Open DevTools while testing

- [ ] T012 Execute TC-3.1: Open DevTools Network tab, hard refresh /awards page, verify trophy.png loads with 200 status and <100ms load time (see quickstart.md lines 75-83)
- [ ] T013 Execute TC-3.2: Run DevTools Performance profiling on /awards page, verify no performance warnings related to trophy.png (see quickstart.md lines 85-93)
- [ ] T014 Execute TC-3.3: Check DevTools Console for errors or warnings related to images (see quickstart.md lines 95-101)

## Phase 3.6: Data Integrity Verification (from quickstart.md Test Suite 5)

**IMPORTANT: Verify content-only change per constitutional Principle II**
**STATUS**: ✅ AUTOMATED VERIFICATION COMPLETE

- [x] T015 Execute TC-5.1: Review public/jsons/awards.json, verify only `image` field was added, no other fields modified (see quickstart.md lines 122-127)
- [x] T016 Execute TC-5.2: Review components/experience.js, verify no code changes were made (see quickstart.md lines 129-134)

## Phase 3.7: Visual Quality Assessment (from quickstart.md Test Suite 6)

**IMPORTANT: Verify professional appearance**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - Visual inspection required

- [ ] T017 Execute TC-6.1: Visually inspect trophy icon clarity, verify it's not pixelated and size is appropriate (see quickstart.md lines 140-147)
- [ ] T018 Execute TC-6.2: Verify trophy icon clearly represents "award" and is more appropriate than placeholder (see quickstart.md lines 149-155)

## Phase 3.8: Cross-Page Consistency (from quickstart.md Test Suite 8)

**IMPORTANT: Verify consistency with existing design**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - Compare with /work-experience page

- [ ] T019 Execute TC-8.1: Compare /awards page with /work-experience page, verify consistent layout structure and image sizing (see quickstart.md lines 180-187)

## Phase 3.9: Quick Smoke Test (from quickstart.md)

**IMPORTANT: Rapid end-to-end verification**
**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING - 5-step verification

- [ ] T020 Execute Quick Smoke Test: Navigate to /awards, verify trophy icons visible, resize to mobile, check console for errors (see quickstart.md lines 223-233)

## Dependencies

```
T001 (Dev server) → T002, T003 (Verification)
T003 (Baseline) → T004, T005 (Content update)
T004, T005 (Content update) → T006-T020 (All testing)
```

## Parallel Execution

**Content Update (Sequential)**:
```bash
# T004 and T005 modify the same file - MUST be sequential
# T004: Add image field to first award entry
# T005: Add image field to second award entry
```

**Testing (Can be batched)**:
```bash
# T006-T020 are all manual verification steps
# Can be executed in a single testing session following quickstart.md
# Open http://localhost:3001/awards once and perform all visual checks
```

## Notes

- **Content-only change**: No component code modifications required
- **Testing strategy**: Manual visual testing via quickstart.md (8 test suites)
- **Performance requirement**: No impact on existing performance (image already exists)
- **Constitutional compliance**: Adheres to Principle II (Content-Driven Development)
- **Estimated time**: 15 minutes (2 minutes for content update, 13 minutes for testing)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after T005 completes (content update done)

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From plan.md Phase 2**:
   - T004-T005: Modify awards.json to add image field (sequential, same file)
   - T002: Verify trophy.png exists (already confirmed in plan)
   - T006-T008: Visual testing on /awards page

2. **From quickstart.md test scenarios**:
   - T006-T008: Test Suite 1 (Trophy Icon Display)
   - T009-T011: Test Suite 2 (Responsive Behavior)
   - T012-T014: Test Suite 3 (Performance Verification)
   - T015-T016: Test Suite 5 (Data-Driven Verification)
   - T017-T018: Test Suite 6 (Visual Quality)
   - T019: Test Suite 8 (Comparison with Other Pages)
   - T020: Quick Smoke Test

3. **From spec.md requirements**:

   - FR-003: Consistent display (T008)
   - FR-004: Responsive sizing (T009-T011)
