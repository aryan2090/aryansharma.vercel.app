## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A visitor lands on the portfolio website and wants to explore specific aspects of the site owner's professional background. Rather than scrolling through a single long page, the visitor can use a navigation menu to quickly jump to dedicated pages for Education, Work Experience, Publications, or Awards. The visitor can also easily return to the home page, view the about section, or contact the site owner.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor is on any page of the website, **When** they look at the top of the page, **Then** they see navigation buttons for "Home", "Education", "Work Experience", "Publications", "Awards", "About", and "Contact me"

2. **Given** a visitor clicks on the "Education" navigation button, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the /education route showing only education-related content

3. **Given** a visitor clicks on the "Work Experience" navigation button, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the /work-experience route showing only work experience content

4. **Given** a visitor clicks on the "Publications" navigation button, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the /publications route showing only publications content

5. **Given** a visitor clicks on the "Awards" navigation button, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the /awards route showing only awards content

6. **Given** a visitor is on any dedicated section page, **When** they click "Home", **Then** they are taken back to the landing page

7. **Given** a visitor clicks "About", **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the about section content

8. **Given** a visitor clicks "Contact me", **When** the page loads, **Then** they see contact information or a contact form

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user navigates directly to a section URL (e.g., types /education in browser)?
- What happens when a user uses browser back/forward buttons after navigating between sections?
- How does navigation appear on mobile devices with limited screen width?
- What happens if a section has no content to display?
